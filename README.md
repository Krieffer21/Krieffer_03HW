## 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
  This homework we were asked to create an application that generates a random password based on the criteria selected by the user. 
  
  ### Asking for Password Length
  This do while loop promts the user to input their desired password length. If they pick a number that it not between 8-128 it will alert them to, 'try again!' until they pick a number within the defined criteria.

### Asking for Character Type Criteria
   This do while loop is where I ask for the users criteria for the password. In the screenshot below are the alerts that confirm what criteria the user would like in their password. If they do not pick any of the criteria it will alert them to 'try again', until they choose one of the criteria.

### Storing Different Character Types
  Based on the users choices the code below will collect all possible character types that can be used in their password.

### Password Generator Gif
  Deployed app: https://krieffer21.github.io/Krieffer_PasswordGenerator/
  The gif below shows what the user will see when using the random password generator. As you can see the user is alerted the various prompts based on the criteria they choose from. If they do not input a valid response they will be alerted to 'try again!', until they input a valid response.
