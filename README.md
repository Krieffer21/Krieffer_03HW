## 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
  This homework we were asked to create an application that generates a random password based on the criteria selected by the user. 

###parseInt
  The block of code shown below, after alerting the user, it prompts them to input a number between the defined perameters. When defining the variable 'between', it takes the length and makes it an integer so we can do calculations. 'parseInt', converts a string into an integer which is helpfull for the do while loop to run efficiently and in defining the contition.
